# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
•	The purpose of the School_District_Analysis Challenge was to change the reading and math scores of the 9th graders in Thomas High School to NaNs for academic dishonesty. After replacing the scores with NaNs, I reran the School_District_Analysis to see how the updated scores affected the overall analysis.
### Results
•	The District Summary was affected by the Overall Passing Percentage, Passing Reading Percentage, Passing Math Percentage, and Average Math Score all decreasing while the Average Reading Score stayed the same.
